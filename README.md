## Install
`composer require bfg/puller`

## In a nutshell
This package is intended for cases when you need a minimum real time, 
but to raise the WebSocket too expensive or meaningless. 
The essence of the package is the simplest Long Pull, 
which is easy to install and configure. 
It added control over the user's tabs, 
which allows us to control the status of all the user 
tabs and send commands to all the user tabs at all, 
to all browsers. So, we have an excellent opportunity to 
follow the online meter and a real-time list of users.
